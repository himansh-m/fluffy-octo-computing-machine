A collection of my ideas.


## Project1
- It is a FEN string simulator. I am thinking of using it for my future project.
- What does it do? If you change the FEN string named start in the simulator. 
- It displays those changes on the board thus, it forms a very useful link between underlying logic and GUI.
#### Notes ( Project1 )
- The library used is SFML.
- The ChessPiecesArray.png might be a little different from the standard. The reason being the black pieces weren't visible on the board.
- If you want you can change any png files with a suitable replacement. Just make sure the sizes are the same.
- You can use the above FEN string simulator to turn your chess game into a GUI.

## Project2
- Abandoned
- Trying to make a game where enemies spawn randomly and try to kill you.
#### Notes ( Project2 )
- Uses SFML.
- Contains atleast a basic structure of the beginning of a game.
